## Description

In this work we introduce five new India brain template (IBTs) spaces, spanning an age range from 6-60 years. Additionally, corresponding atlases (IBTAs) from FreeSurfer-defined atlases have been created for each space, along with tissue-specific maps and segmentations.

These should form useful reference templates and region maps for brain imaging studies involving predominantly Indian populations.
